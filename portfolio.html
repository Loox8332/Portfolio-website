                <h2>Autonomous SLAM monocular depth mapper using MDE models & ROS </h2>
                <p>Currently, I have been working on a monocular SLAM mapper that recreates its environment digitally using a single RGB camera. By incorporating open source MDE computer vision models, I have been able to recreate accurate depth maps in real time for future use with ROS for full environment mapping. This project has already highlighted my advanced practical design skills in both software and hardware applications. Furthermore, this experience with neural networks will allow me to apply my A.I. knowledge to my future works. </p>

                <h2>6 DOF manipulator</h2>
                <p>To enhance my software and coding related skills, I worked on modelling a 6 DOF robotic manipulator with the goal of local environment mapping and object control. This project allowed me to develop my knowledge surrounding ROS and UDRP while also teaching me how to code in C++ and Java. In addition to this, my experience working collaboratively with git version control gave me an opportunity to demonstrate adaptability and flexibility working with advanced projects. Ultimately, I was unable to create any prototypes of my works due to the high cost involved in development.</p>

                <h2>Royal Mint research project</h2>
                <p>As part of a nominated project with The Royal Mint, I led a research driven team initiative with a focus on historical innovation that rediscovered a previously lost 17th century coin manufacturing method. Key highlights of my role included authoring a detailed research article uncovering and re-evaluating evidence on the evolution of raised edge coin manufacturing, collaborating with scholars, and exploring new research territories for The Royal Mint. Alongside this I guided a team of five in the design and creation of a functional prototype of this method, that was once a pivotal tool in British coinage production. This project honed my research skills and strengthened my leadership skills, historical investigation, and collaborative innovation.</p>

                <h2>Distance sensor using HC-SR04 sensor and ST7735 TFT screen</h2>
                <p>Using python imaging library, I was able to create an accurate distance sensor display with a resolution of Â±0.1cm using both the HC-SR04 sensor and ST7735-TFT screen. This project allowed me to develop my use and understanding of how hardware components can be used practically. It has also allowed me to refine my code management skills through version control with git.</p>
