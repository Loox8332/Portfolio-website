    <p class="about" style="padding-bottom: 30%;">
        current second-year mechanical and electrical engineering student at the university of bristol. i spend my time using my problem solving and engineering skills to work on advanced personal projects alongside my degree. my academic work combines a strong foundation in mechanical design, electronics, and systems integration, which is relevant for my passion in fields such as robotics, renewable energy solutions, and sustainable product development.
        <br><br>
        in addition to my studies, i enjoy working on challenging projects to enhance my practical understanding of my interests. i am currently working on a 6 dof manipulator using ros to model its motion, teaching myself everything as i go. all my projects are detailed on my website.
        <br><br>
        throughout my learning, both through my degree and out of it, i have gained advanced coding knowledge in python, java, c, and more. i have also learnt how to design circuits and mechanical components using a variety of cad packages. this knowledge has helped me succeed in my degree and allowed me to work more collaboratively on group design projects, where i have refined my problem solving and communications skills.
        <br><br>
        i am excited to gain more experience in industry through internships and placement opportunities in which i can share my enthusiasm and innovation deliver meaningful impact. i aspire to work sustainably and effectively to provide engineering solutions for a better, more advanced future.</p>
