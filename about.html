    <p class="about" style="padding-bottom: 30%;">
        Current second-year mechanical and electrical engineering student at the University of Bristol. I spend my time using my problem solving and engineering skills to work on advanced personal projects alongside my degree. My academic work combines a strong foundation in mechanical design, electronics, and systems integration, which is relevant for my passion in fields such as robotics, renewable energy solutions, and sustainable product development.
        <br><br>
        In addition to my studies, I enjoy working on challenging projects to enhance my practical understanding of my interests. I am currently working on a 6 dof manipulator using ros to model its motion, teaching myself everything as I go. All my projects are detailed on my website.
        <br><br>
        Throughout my learning, both through my degree and out of it, I have gained advanced coding knowledge in Python, Java, C, and more. I have also learnt how to design circuits and mechanical components using a variety of cad packages. This knowledge has helped me succeed in my degree and allowed me to work more collaboratively on group design projects, where I have refined my problem solving and communications skills.
        <br><br>
        I am excited to gain more experience in industry through internships and placement opportunities in which I can share my enthusiasm and innovation deliver meaningful impact. I aspire to work sustainably and effectively to provide engineering solutions for a better, more advanced future.</p>
